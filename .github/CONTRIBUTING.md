# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute. This is a voluntary project and we couldn't do it without your help.
Contributing is a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies, their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.


## Report feedback

All bugs, feature requests, questions, feedback, etc., is welcome. Feel free to post them [here](https://github.com/wslyvh/raiden-api-client/issues) and use one of the templates provided. Before you do, please make sure no similar issues have been reported. You might find your answer there.


## Create Pull Requests (PRs)

As a contributor, you are expected to fork this repository and then submit pull requests. Pull requests will be reviewed and merged into the main repo. See ["Fork a repo"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) how this works.


### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. 
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Make sure to follow the coding style of the project and use a linter `npm run lint`.
- Make sure to run the tests `npm run test`! Write or adapt them as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch.
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Your pull request will be approved and merged by one the project team or core contributors.

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
